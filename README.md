# The Quack Client/Server Protocol for DuckDB

> Quack is released as a pre-release extension and is currently experimental. If you encounter any issues, please file them [via GitHub](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-quack/issues).

The `quack` extension adds a client-server protocol to DuckDB. With this extension, DuckDB can act as both a server and a client to communicate over a network. For more details, please see
the [announcement page](https://duckdb.org/quack),
the [blog post](https://duckdb.org/2026/05/12/quack-remote-protocol)
and the [documentation](https://duckdb.org/docs/current/quack/overview).

## Usage Example

The Quack extensions autoinstalls and [autoloads](https://duckdb.org/docs/current/extensions/overview#autoloading-extensions) on first use.
You can also install and load it manually using:

```sql
INSTALL quack;
LOAD quack;
```

Start Quack on one DuckDB instance, the server, using:

```sql
CALL quack_serve('quack:localhost', token = 'super_secret');
CREATE TABLE hello AS FROM VALUES ('world') v(s);
```

And talk to this server from another instance:

```sql
CREATE SECRET (TYPE quack, TOKEN 'super_secret');
ATTACH 'quack:localhost' AS remote;
FROM remote.hello;
```

This should show the content of the remote table `hello` on the client side.

### Starting the server from a secret

The server can take its token from a `quack` secret instead of the `token` parameter.
Without arguments, `quack_serve` uses the default secret; `secret = 'name'` picks a specific
one. When the chosen secret is scoped to a concrete endpoint, that endpoint is what the server
listens on:

```sql
CREATE SECRET s1 (TYPE quack, TOKEN 'super_secret', SCOPE 'quack:localhost:9494');
CALL quack_serve(secret = 's1');   -- listens on quack:localhost:9494 with token 'super_secret'
```

```sql
CREATE SECRET (TYPE quack, TOKEN 'super_secret');
CALL quack_serve();                -- default secret, listens on quack:localhost
```

If no secret matches and no `token` is given, `quack_serve` generates a random token and
returns it in the `auth_token` column. To keep that token across restarts, ask for it to be
persisted:

```sql
CALL quack_serve(create_secret_if_not_exists = true);
```

This writes the token to a persistent default secret (`__default_quack`, scoped to `quack:`), so
the next `quack_serve` - and any client on the machine - reuses the same token. It only does so
when there is nothing to reuse yet: if a secret was named with `secret =`, or a default secret
already matches, nothing is written.

### Connecting through a secret

The client side mirrors this. `ATTACH` takes a `SECRET` name, and a bare `quack:` path takes its
endpoint from that secret, so both ends of the connection can be described by the same secret:

```sql
CREATE SECRET s1 (TYPE quack, TOKEN 'super_secret', SCOPE 'quack:localhost:9494');
ATTACH 'quack:' AS remote (TYPE quack, SECRET s1);   -- connects to quack:localhost:9494
```

Without a `SECRET` name the default secret is used: the one whose scope matches the path, or - when
the path names no host - the only `quack` secret there is. A path given explicitly always wins over
the scope of the secret, and a secret scoped to nothing more specific than `quack:` leaves the
default host in place.

We can also copy data from client to server:

```sql
-- on client
CREATE TABLE remote.hello2 AS FROM VALUES ('world2') v(s);
```

```sql
-- on server
FROM hello2;
```

## Development

### Managing dependencies
DuckDB extensions uses VCPKG for dependency management. Enabling VCPKG via the provided makefile target:
```shell
make setup-vcpkg
export VCPKG_TOOLCHAIN_PATH=`pwd`/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
```

### Build steps

Now to build the extension, run:

```bash
make
```

The main binaries that will be built are:

```bash
./build/release/duckdb
./build/release/test/unittest
./build/release/extension/quack/quack.duckdb_extension
```

- `duckdb` is the binary for the duckdb shell with the extension code automatically loaded.
- `unittest` is the test runner of duckdb. Again, the extension is already linked into the binary.
- `quack.duckdb_extension` is the loadable binary as it would be distributed.

### Running the tests

Different tests can be created for DuckDB extensions. The primary way of testing DuckDB extensions should be the SQL tests in `./test/sql`. These SQL tests can be run using:

```bash
make test
```
